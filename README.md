# FCC-photogallery
FreeCodeCamp CSS-photo-gallery challenge

I found this challenge quite enjoyable and the final outcome was amazing.

I started off by creating New Repo - FCC-photogallery and then cloning this to my pc.
I created html and styles files and then proceeded with the challenge.
The html boilerplate was a little different as i had to include the following <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1.0">
Within my html body element i had to include ten x img elements ( numbering 1 - 10 )

CSS - #gallery - display, flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, padding
    - #gallery img - width, height, object-fit ( this is something new i learnt ), padding, border-radius
    
    @media ( this is something new to me and had to google and find some help with this but it appears to be clear now )
